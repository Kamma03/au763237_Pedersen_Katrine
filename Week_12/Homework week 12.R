######################################## ADD DATA TO LEAFLET

# Before you can proceed to Task 2, you need to learn about coordinate creation. 
# In this section you will manually create machine-readable spatial
# data from GoogleMaps, load these into R, and display them in Leaflet with addMarkers(): 

### First, go to https://bit.ly/CreateCoordinates1
### Enter the coordinates of your favorite leisure places in Denmark 
# extracting them from the URL in googlemaps, adding name and type of monument.
# Remember to copy the coordinates as a string, as just two decimal numbers separated by comma. 

# Caveats: Do NOT edit the grey columns! They populate automatically!

### Second, read the sheet into R. You will need gmail login information. 
# IMPORTANT: watch the console, it may ask you to authenticate or put in the number 
# that corresponds to the account you wish to use.
#install.packages("googlesheets4")
# Libraries
library(tidyverse)
library(googlesheets4)
library(leaflet)

# If you experience difficulty with your read_sheet() function (it is erroring out), 
# uncomment and run the following function:
gs4_deauth()  # run this line and then rerun the read_sheet() function below

# Read in the Google sheet you've edited
places <- read_sheet("https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1U6JgrE14NKu6bIa6hlHcf5dc82Cv2WKQZ4WjiotySUs/edit?usp=sharing",
                     col_types = "cccnncnc",   # check that you have the right number and type of columns
                     range = "DK2025")  # select the correct worksheet name

glimpse(places)  
# Question 3: are the Latitude and Longitude columns present? 
# Do they contain numeric decimal degrees?



# If your coordinates look good, see how you can use addMarkers() function to
# load them in a basic map. Run the lines below and check: are any points missing? Why?
leaflet() %>% 
  addTiles() %>% 
  addMarkers(lng = places$Longitude, 
             lat = places$Latitude,
             popup = paste(places$Description, "<br>", places$Type))
# Now that you have learned how to load points from a googlesheet to a basic leaflet map, 
# apply the know-how to YOUR DANmap object.

######################################## TASK TWO


# Task 2: Read in the googlesheet data you and your colleagues created
# into your DANmap object (with 11 background layers you created in Task 1).

######################################## TASK THREE

# Task 3: Can you cluster the points in Leaflet?
# Hint: Google "clustering options in Leaflet in R"

# Solution
leaflet(places) %>% 
  addTiles() %>% 
  addMarkers(clusterOptions = markerClusterOptions())

######################################## TASK FOUR

# Task 4: Look at the two maps (with and without clustering) and consider what
# each is good for and what not.

# Your brief answer
#Without you are able to see all the places spread on the map, but with clustering you can tell in which areas that there are the most places. It gives a better overview with the clustering, but you can go more in depth without.

######################################## TASK FIVE

# Task 5: Find out how to display the notes and classifications column in the map. 
# Hint: Check online help in sites such as 
# https://r-charts.com/spatial/interactive-maps-leaflet/#popup

# Solution
